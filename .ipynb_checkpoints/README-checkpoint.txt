- The code is in "global-wheat-detection-final.ipynb"
- I have added comments as much as possible to understand the code.
- The dependencies/requirements are in "requirements.txt"
- The model JSON file is in "Final_model_structure.json"
- As the Trained model weights file size is about 400 MB, I'm not attaching the file. If needed please inform me.
